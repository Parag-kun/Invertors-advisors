This is a NextJs task for Go India Advisors

- Clone this repository
- Open terminal in the project directory and run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser
- I would recommend to install some extension like [Mobile Simulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mobile-simulator-responsi/ckejmhbmlajgoklhgbapkiccekfoccmk) (for chrome) to view in mobile as I believe browser dev tools (especially chrome) do not properly display small screen views
- To view in `Mobile Simulator` first install the extension then open `http://localhost:3000` and use the extension.

Thank you for considering for the opportunity!
